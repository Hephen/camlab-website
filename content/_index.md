The Campbell Lab is a group of data scientists working at the interface of statistics, machine learning, and translational biomedicine. We are based in Toronto's Discovery District at the 
[Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute of Sinai Health System](http://www.lunenfeld.ca/researchers/campbell)
and the Departments of [Molecular Genetics](http://www.moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca/) and [Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto.

We have a number of research focusses including:
* Computational modelling of single-cell and spatially resolved 'omics data 
* Understanding the composition and dynamics of the tumour microenvironment and how it enables tumour progression
* Machine learning algorithms to help automate biological and biomedical data analysis
